## About the name and logo

The [Mancuspia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancuspia) are imaginary creatures invented by the Argentinian author [Julio Cort√°zar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_Cort%C3%A1zar). 
Although **not**  necessarily resembling the logo, an exact description was always left up the reader's imagination.
