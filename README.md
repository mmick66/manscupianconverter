It was built using [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and [Antd](https://ant.design/) for the UI.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmick66/manscupianconverter
cd manscupianconverter
npm install
npm start
```

## Packaging into an App

This app uses `electron-builder` for compilation so put assets such as icons inside of the `build` folder

```bash
npm run release
```

Then look inside the `dist` folder of this repo for the compiled app.

## About the name and logo

The [Mancuspia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancuspia) are imaginary creatures invented by the Argentinian author [Julio Cort√°zar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_Cort%C3%A1zar). An exact depiction was always left to the reader's imagination.
